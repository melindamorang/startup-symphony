# startup-symphony

A website about how to start a community orchestra (or band or choir) in your town based on my experience founding the Redlands Community Orchestra and administering the Dexter Community Orchestra.

This repo holds the website's files, which are hosted through GitHub Pages. The site itself can be viewed at https://startupsymphony.org/.
